# Master Production Planning Repository

This repository contains various Jupyter Notebooks that explore different production planning strategies. It aims to find the most cost-effective production schedules based on a range of heuristics and methods.

## Description

The notebooks in this repository cover multiple production strategies such as:
- One Time Run
- Lot for Lot (Chase)
- Fixed EOQ
- Periodic Order Quantity
- Least Period Cost (Silver-Meal)
- Least Unit Cost
- Part-Period Balancing
- Wagner-Whitin
- Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)

Each notebook includes:
- Calculations of production plans.
- Visualisations of forecasts, productions, and inventory levels.
- Comparisons of costs and efficiencies of different production strategies.

## Installation

To run these notebooks, you will need Python and Jupyter installed on your system. You will also need to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/production-planning.git
cd production-planning
```

Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the desired notebook and run the cells to see the results.
